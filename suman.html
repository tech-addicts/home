            towards a career.</div>
        <div class="question">What skills got you the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I was into Product management from 2nd year itself. So I narrowed my skillset accordingly so
            that I could give macro focus on the domain</div>
        <div class="question">Does CGPA matter for this kind of internship ?</div>

            opening. Don't lose hope.
