        <div class="question">Where did you interned at ?</div>
        <div class="answer">L&T Construction</div>
        <div class="question">Why did you opt for this internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Initially, I wasn't sure about doing private job in future. So basically to get an idea of
            corporate life and the work culture, I opted to go for it. Research hasn't been my interest till now and as
            far as government organization is concerned, learning is limited especially during internship.</div>
        <div class="question">How will an internship at a Private firm affect my career ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Internship plays a very vital role for getting you in a better shape before you kick-start
            your career. You get to meet new People, learn from their experiences, and more importantly, you're exposed
            to the real world and deal with real-life problems.</div>
        <div class="question">What skills got you the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">The first criteria to sit for the internship test was to be among the top-10 students of
            your respective departments. I wasn't that strong technically but my interpersonal skills really helped me
            to get through the HR round comfortably.</div>
        <div class="question">Does CGPA matter for this kind of internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yeah, CGPA did matter for this internship but it wasn't the sole thing responsible for
            securing it. If you're low with your CGPA, try improving it as much you can in the upcoming semesters. While
            doing that focus on developing your soft skills along with other technical skills, it will help you grow in
            confidence.</div>
        <div class="question">Whom did you approach for the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I got this internship after qualifying the written test and the HR interview when this
            company visited our campus for placement drive during my 3rd Year.</div>
        <div class="question">What was the medium of application ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Medium of application was through the training and placement cell of our college.</div>
        <div class="question">Was an insider recommendation required for the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, insider recommendation wasn't required for this internship. If you don't have an insider
            to recommend you, try getting it through your college alumni who are already working in the companies you're
            interested to apply in.</div>
        <div class="question">How many private firms / Universities / government companies did you approach ?</div>
        <div class="answer">It was the first company that visited our campus for internship and I got selected in it.
            So, I didn't approach any other organization after that.
        </div>
        <div class="question">When did you start sending out requests ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I started sending out requests a month after commencement of my 5th semester though it
            didn't count in the end.</div>
        <div class="question">Anything else should know about the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Don't depend on theoretical knowledge only. Focus on soft skills. They're very important and
            they add a touch to your personality which gives a positive impression about you in any interview you face.
            There's no such thing as right time. The only time you've is now. So start working now and ultimately you'll
            do something wonderful.</div>
