            For suppose i worked on project to know the information of other figther jets surrounding our plane using
            radar signals emitted by them to know our presence.
            <br><br>So here we simulated radar sequences using matlab
            And code for information identification is written in c++.<br><br>
            We downloaded it in fgpa chip to make it work in plane.</div>
