        <div class="question">Where did you interned at ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I interned in University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada via MITACS. It was jointly funded by
            MITACS (Canada) and MHRD (Ministry of Human Resources & Development), India.</div>
        <div class="question">Why did you opt for this internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer"> I opted for this internship becausez Mitacs GRI (Globalink Research Internship) is one of
            the most prestigious research internships in the world. As I am always interested in pursuing research, so I
            didn't opt an internship in any private firm/company.</div>
        <div class="question">How will an internship at a Private firm affect my career ?</div>
        <div class="answer">This kind of research internship that I did will greatly effect your resume if you're
            further interested in pursuing research or if you want to go abroad for further studies, and that's why i
            did it.</div>
        <div class="question">What skills got you the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I got selected in a project of Experimental Fluid Dynamics, which is my subject of interest.
            I believe my previous projects (which were related to this one) plus my previous work in Image Processing &
            Analysis in softwares such as ImageJ, MATLAB & PIVLab got me this internship.</div>
        <div class="question">Does CGPA matter for this kind of internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, CGPA highly matters for this kind of internship. MITACS kept 8.5 CGPA as the minimum
            bar, but the higher your grade point is, it is more likely that you'll be selected. Anyway almost all the
            research internships will require you to have a moderate to high CGPA.</div>
        <div class="question">Whom did you approach for the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I applied for this one via the portal of MITACS. It's open every year in August - September.
            You can check the website here for more info:
            https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship </div>
        <div class="question">What was the medium of application ?</div>
        <div class="answer">For this internship, you have to apply through their portal only. They'll contact you
            regarding any necessary information via your email.</div>
        <div class="question">Was an insider recommendation required for the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, for this one you need to have at least one recommendation letter from one of your
            teachers/previous project guide. I was recommended by an professor in IIT Guwahati under whom I previously
            did my summer internship project. It's not "insider recommendation", more of a mandatory one that you need
            to have to apply.
        </div>
        <div class="question">How many private firms / Universities / government companies did you approach ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I applied for this one and another government research internship FAST-SF, 2019 via Indian
            Academy of Science. I got selected in both. But I had to let go of the later since I already went through
            all the procedures (visa and all) for the former one.
        </div>
        <div class="question">When did you start sending out requests ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I applied for both the internships in the given timeline, which is usually August -
            September for MITACS and October - November for FAST-SF if you're planning to do your internship in the
            summer of next year.</div>
        <div class="question">Anything else should know about the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I wish I could advise you more about internships in private industries/firms. They usually
            require some inside contacts along with your skills. But since I don't have experience about these
            internships, I'm not the right person to talk about that. If you want to know more about MITACS Globalink
            Research Internship, feel free to ask me with your specific questions.</div>
