        <div class="question">Where did you interned at ?</div>
        <div class="answer">IIT BOMBAY</div>
        <div class="question">Why did you opt for this internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">At the end of my 2nd year I had 2 internships offer one from IITB and other from a startup
            BotSync Pvt. Ltd. I choose to join IITB as Eklavya is considered as one of the finest research Internship
            available in India with students participating from IITs and NITs. Secondly, IITB would be the best place to
            learn and spend summer under guidance of one of best project managers and professor in country.</div>
        <div class="question">How will an internship at a Private firm affect my career ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Internship at a IIT would definitely boost the resume and would give you an upper hand over
            other candidates while applying for internships or jobs in future.</div>
        <div class="question">What skills got you the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Eklavya does not require anyone to know a lot of things. Some previous projects, a decent
            pointer and good grasp of c/c++ is sufficient.
        </div>
        <div class="question">Does CGPA matter for this kind of internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">CGPA do matter it requires atleast 8.5 cgpa.
            But it also does have some software quota which doesn't require any cgpa. Students are assigned tasks to
            complete and are judged on basis of that.</div>
        <div class="question">Whom did you approach for the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer"> A online portal opens up at the end of Feb and then followed by 3 rounds of selection.
        </div>
        <div class="question">Was an insider recommendation required for the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes a recommendation from a professor can help but is not necessary.
        </div>
        <div class="question">When did you start sending out requests ?</div>
        <div class="answer">February starting
        </div>
        <div class="question">Anything else should know about the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">In my opinion Eklavya is one of best internship opportunity one can look forward to. Being
            in IITB for two months and working on large scale projects not only gives a lot of skills but also very good
            exposure and connections. One can learn a lot of things from students from other IITs and NITs. The mentors
            are really very helpful and are available for most of the time for help and guidance. Students get ample
            time to learn and work on projects.</div>
