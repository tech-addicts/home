        <div class="question">Where did you interned at ?</div>
        <div class="answer"> I have interned at IIT Kanpur, remotely at IIT Gandhinagar and at this summer(2019) I
            interned at IIT Patna.</div>
        <div class="question">Why did you opt for this internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Doing a summer internship at a reputed university/college like an IIT always has its
            benefits. The projects are very good. You get to work with top-class professors and you learn a lot. IIT
            internships are hectic and quite stressful as the projects are generally research-based, which means no one
            or very few people have actually worked on the topic you are working on. This makes the project more
            challenging as you have to figure out the solution on your own. I personally wanted to do my internships at
            IITs because of the awesome projects that they offers 7 also because of the really awesome student life at
            IITs. The campuses have a lot of recreational facilities, labs, libraries, gyms, canteens are open 24 hours.
            Had I interned at any private company/organization I would have earned a good amount of money as stipend,
            but choosing to intern at IITs was more of a personal preference.</div>
        <div class="question">How will an internship at a Private firm affect my career ?</div>
        <div class="answer">If you are planning to go for higher studies, I would suggest that you intern at government
            organizations like IITs/IIITs/IAS as they provide very good projects which when done effectively will
            certainly make one’s resume stand out among the others. Moreover, if you’ve done a good job at your
            internship, the professors give a letter of recommendation which is very valuable.
            If your primary goal is to do a job after 4 years of engineering, I would suggest that you intern at any
            startup where you can really learn and code a lot, which will essentially help you in securing a good job.
        </div>
        <div class="question">What skills got you the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Getting the first internship is tough. I had started developing skills quite early(beginning
            of 2nd year). I took some online courses on Udemy and Coursera on Android App Development and made a small
            app. Then, I started applying to small startups through online platforms like Let’s Intern and Internshala.
            I landed a work-from-home internship where I had to design/develop coding quetions and solutions(in
            C/C++/JAVA) asked in interviews. Other than that, I used to keep learning something or the other and kept on
            doing projects and adding them to my GitHub profile. After that I had applied to the summer school at IIT-K.
            I was one of the 55 students selected for the summer school and it was fully funded being sponsored by Intel
            and AMD. That helped me in getting the subsequent internships.</div>
        <div class="question">Does CGPA matter for this kind of internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Getting internships at major IITs or any other government organization is tough and yes CGPA
            as well as college matters. The process is highly competitive and the higher the cgpa the higher are your
            chances of getting accepted. If your cgpa is low, don’t worry. You can still get an internship, provided you
            have some excellent projects to show in your resume.</div>
        <div class="question">Whom did you approach for the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer"> I applied online through the portal for IIT-K summer school. For the IIT-P internship, I
            had emailed the professors. For my 3rd year internship, I had applyed online as well as emailed the
            professors. </div>
        <div class="question">What was the medium of application ?</div>
        <div class="answer">Email. It should be short and to the point. Highlight your major achievements (for eg. If
            you rank among top 10 in your department, don’t be shy to mention it). State your reason/interest for
            wanting to do an internship under the guidance of the said professor, attach your resume and send it. You’ll
            get 1-2 positive replies for every 60-70 emails you send.</div>
        <div class="question">Was an insider recommendation required for the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer"> I didn’t have any insider recommendation for my internships. Although it is sometimes good
            to have some known people who can recommend you. During my stay at IIT-K, I had interacted with professors
            from IISc/IIT-Gn/IIIT-H and later on during my 3rd year, they were more than happy to provide me an
            internship opportunity.</div>
        <div class="question">How many private firms / Universities / government companies did you approach ?</div>
        <div class="answer">I didn’t approach any private company for internship once my profile was built. I applied to
            all the IITs, emailed all professors who were working in the domain I was interested in.</div>
        <div class="question">When did you start sending out requests ?</div>
        <div class="answer"> I stared applying from mid - January. By the end of March, I had 5 internship offers in
            hand, all from IITs/IIITs.</div>
        <div class="question">Anything else should know about the internship ?</div>
        <div class="answer"> My advice is to start building your profile from 1st year itself. If not, then from 2nd
            year. Otherwise, getting a good internship is very tough. Start contributing to open-source projects on
            GitHub. If you’re unable to get any internship, then sit at home, learn a new technology and then do a
            project on it. Implement what you’ve learnt. Add it to your GitHub profile with a nice Readme. If you’re
            looking for IIT internship, keep your academics good. Don’t let your grades drop too much. Try to identify
            and choose your area of interest and stick to it. Start early and you’ll definitely do well.</div>
